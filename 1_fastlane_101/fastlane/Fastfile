# Welcome to Fastlane! 
# Here are a few examples of the most basic building blocks

# NOTICE:  Although syntactically correct, this cannot run without further configuration and -- of course -- an iOS project!

# To discover what actions are avaialble:
# => fastlane actions

# To see all the configuration options available for an action try:
# => fastlane action <action_name>

  lane :build_and_upload do 
    wave_from "the top."        # function: call a ruby function
    build_ios_app               # action: build an IPA of an iOS application
    upload_to_app_store         # action: upload the IPA to the AppStore

    build_with_tests            # private_lane: call another private lane
    upload_to_app_store         # action: upload the IPA to the AppStore
